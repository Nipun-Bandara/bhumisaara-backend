 * The backend holds no web3 client — every chain interaction in this system is
 * signed and read in the browser — so the caller reads the authoritative
 * {@code balanceOf(wallet, tokenId)} for each {@link #seasonTokenIds} entry and
 * displays it next to {@link #ledgerBalanceCredits}. A gap between the two is
 * itself the signal: it means credits moved off-platform.
